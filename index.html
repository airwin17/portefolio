                        Hi,I am a web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly websites. I have experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React,
                        as well as some exposure to Java and nodejs with both SQL and no SQL databases. I enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.
                        I have worked on several projects, like e-commerce platforms. You can see some of my work in the portfolio section below.
                        I am looking for opportunities to grow my skills and contribute to meaningful web development projects.
